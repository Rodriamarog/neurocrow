We need to make a plan for this:

Add these permissons to the login flow:

For instagram:
instagram_business_manage_comments​
instagram_business_content_publish
​
For facebook:
pages_manage_posts
pages_manage_engagement

After that, make a specific page/dashboard in the website where I can see Urban Edge FB and Instagram pages and 
publish a posts, and make comments, and edit comments, answer customer comments, etc. Something I can demonstrate the proper use of these permissions we are requesting.

Learn facebook ads and make the design ads.
